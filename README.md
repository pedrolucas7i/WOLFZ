# 🐺 WOLFZ

**WOLFZ** is a Windows program that simulates a “total system takeover,” creating an intense, chaotic, and immersive experience.
Once executed, it triggers a series of visual, auditory, and behavioral effects that make the computer appear completely out of control — without causing actual harm to the system.

It’s a provocative tool, developed for **educational, artistic, or demonstrative** purposes, mimicking the behavior of a system being corrupted or hacked.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT WARNING:** This program **must not be run on third-party machines without explicit consent.**
> While it is not malicious, its effects can be disturbing and convincingly simulate critical system failure.
